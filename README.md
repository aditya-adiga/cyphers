# cyphers
This is a fun project which focuses on using brute force to decrypt text files which have been encoded using some different methods.
ps4a.py contains a function which returns permutations of an input.
ps4b.py has functions which are used to encrypt and decrypt text files by using a shifting dictionary.
ps4c.py uses substitution cyphers where one letter is replaced randomly with another letter.
(But in our implementation we do this only for vowels because of time complexity of this problem).
story.txt contains a hidden message which can read by using a shift cypher(ps4b.py).
words.txt contains the word which we will use to check the authencity of the text message input.
